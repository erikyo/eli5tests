# Explain Like I'm 5 Tests

Hey there little buddy! 👋 Welcome to the "Explain Like I'm 5 Tests" repository, where we're going to have some fun understanding how tests work, just like playing with your favorite toys!

## What's Inside?

### Animal Kingdom 🐾

Imagine we have a magical world called the "Animal Kingdom," where there are animals of all shapes and sizes. We created a special class called `Animal` that helps us describe these creatures.

```javascript
class Animal {
  // ... (some code magic)
}
```

These animals have names, colors, and even emojis! 🦄

### Dogs 🐶

Now, let's talk about dogs – those furry friends who go "woof woof" or "yip yip"! We've got a class called `Dog` that tells us all about them.

```javascript
class Dog extends Animal {
  // ... (more code magic)
}
```

Dogs can bark, and depending on their size, they either go "Woof woof!" if they're big or "Yip yip!" if they're small. Don't forget their emojis – they're like little badges of honor! 🏅

### Cats 🐱

Next up, we have cool cats! 🐱 The `Cat` class is in charge of our feline friends.

```javascript
class Cat extends Animal {
  // ... (even more code magic)
}
```

Cats meow and purr, and they have their own emojis too! 🐱

## Let's Play with Tests! 🎉

Now, we've got some tests to make sure our Animal Kingdom is working as expected. Imagine tests are like little detectives checking if everything is in order.

### Naming and Coloring 🌈

We check if our animals have names and colors, and even make sure they use the right emojis! We want everything to be just perfect.

### Dog Barks 🐕

For our dogs, we test if they bark correctly. Big dogs go "Woof woof!" and small dogs go "Yip yip!" We also check if they proudly wear their doggy emojis. 🐶

### Cat Meows and Purrs 😸

Our cats are special too! We test if they meow, purr, and show off their cute cat emojis. 🐱

## How to Play with Tests

To play with these tests, you'll need a magical tool called Jest. It's like a wizard that helps us run our tests and see if everything is working like it should.

## Let's Wrap It Up!

And there you have it, kiddo! 🌟 That's how we make sure our Animal Kingdom is happy and playful. Just like you, we want everything to be perfect and full of joy!

Now, go ahead and explore this magical world of tests. If you ever have questions, just ask – we're here to play and learn together! 🚀
